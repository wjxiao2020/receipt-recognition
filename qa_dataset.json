However, without the service charge, the subtotal is $21,818, and the tax is $2,182, which adds up to a total of $24,000 - $2,182 = $21,818. The missing service charge would make up the difference between the calculated subtotal and the actual total, which is $24,000 - $21,818 = $2,182. Therefore, the service charge is also $2,182.",
